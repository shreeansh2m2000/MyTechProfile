CSmart (Cloud-Secured Managed Automated Tool) is an Azure cloud management platform designed to simplify and automate the monitoring, optimization, and governance of cloud resources. Acting as an integrated dashboard, it enables businesses to manage hundreds of Azure resources across multiple subscriptions through a single, user-friendly interface. CSmart empowers organizations to efficiently automate reporting, improve cost visibility, enforce compliance, and enhance resource health monitoring.

## Business Challenges

- **Complex Azure Environments**  
  Difficulty managing and monitoring hundreds of resources spread across numerous subscriptions and groups.

- **Data Overload**  
  Manual aggregation and transformation of telemetry and configuration data from disparate sources were effort-intensive and inefficient.

- **Insufficient Automation**  
  Deployment, monitoring, and reporting tasks often required custom solutions, limiting scalability and increasing risks.

- **Limited Visibility and Optimization**  
  Suboptimal discoverability of assets, restricted out-of-the-box monitoring, and basic cost management capabilities.

- **Compliance Risks**  
  Lack of unified policy enforcement and auditability for Azure resources increased compliance challenges.

## Solution

CSmart delivers a comprehensive solution with the following capabilities:

### 1. **Unified Monitoring and Management**
- Centralizes monitoring for PaaS, IaaS, storage, networking, and application resources (e.g., VMs, SQL, Function Apps, Service Bus, Key Vault).
- Allows resource control actions (start/stop/delete/tag) directly from the dashboard.
- Visualizes deployments and offers resource categorization by compute, storage, networking, and PaaS types.

### 2. **Application Health & Resource Status**
- Real-time dashboards with granular health metrics (Healthy/Warning/Critical), customizable response code-based rules, and drill-down for diagnostics.
- Detailed application and API performance monitoring, including response times and top error analysis.
- Extensible alerting via email, Teams, and Slack.

### 3. **Resource Status Board**
- Health status for resources (VM, SQL, etc.) based on customizable thresholds.
- Advisory recommendations and notification triggers for critical and warning states.
- Drill-through views with detailed resource metrics and configurations.

### 4. **Cost Monitoring & Optimization**
- Near real-time visualization of actual/forecast costs and top cost drivers at resource group and type levels.
- Cost recommendations surfaced through Power BI with impact status (High/Medium/Low) and resource-level details.

### 5. **Automated Deployment and Governance**
- Automated single-click deployment of standalone and blueprint resources, integrating CI/CD via Azure DevOps and Terraform scripts.
- Blueprints for complex architectures, including infrastructure-as-code support and landing zones.
- Policy-based compliance enforcement, identity management, and audit logging for governance.

### 6. **Network & Security Management**
- Automated hybrid setup (VPN, ExpressRoute, firewalls), network peering, and security recommendations.
- Central platform for network configuration and monitoring.

### 7. **Extensible Reporting**
- Power BI integration for advanced reporting, custom dashboards, and role-based views (RLS).
- API-based and Angular-driven report delivery.
