## Business Challenges

- **Complex Multi-Cloud Listings**
  - Each marketplace (AWS, Azure, GCP) has its own onboarding, technical, and compliance requirements, making multi-cloud listing manual and error-prone.
- **Operational Inefficiency**
  - Manual tracking, product content updates, and API integration for each cloud hinder speed and scalability.
- **Resource Constraints**
  - Significant time and skilled resources required to build and maintain technical integrations for cross-cloud marketplace listings.
- **Lack of Unified Visibility**
  - Separate dashboards and processes for each cloud create overhead in managing offers, customer subscriptions, and performance reporting.
